[[batch-infrastrucutre-configuration-improvements]]
== Batch infrastructure configuration improvements

=== New annotations and classes for batch infrastructure configuration

Before v6, the `@EnableBatchProcessing` annotation was tied to a JDBC-based infrastructure. This is not the case anymore. Two new annotations have been introduced to configure the underlying job repository: `@EnableJdbcJobRepository` and `@EnableMongoJobRepository`.

Starting from v6, `@EnableBatchProcessing` allows you to configure common attributes for the batch infrastructure, while store-specific attributes can be specified with the new dedicated annotations.

Here is an example of how to use these annotations:

[source, java]
----
@EnableBatchProcessing(taskExecutorRef = "batchTaskExecutor")
@EnableJdbcJobRepository(dataSourceRef = "batchDataSource", transactionManagerRef = "batchTransactionManager")
class MyJobConfiguration {

	@Bean
	public Job job(JobRepository jobRepository) {
		return new JobBuilder("job", jobRepository)
                    // job flow omitted
                    .build();
	}
}
----

Similarly, the programmatic model based on `DefaultBatchConfiguration` has been updated by introducing two new configuration classes to define store-specific attributes: `JdbcDefaultBatchConfiguration` and `MongoDefaultBatchConfiguration`.
These classes can be used to configure specific attributes of each job repository as well as other batch infrastructure beans programmatically.

=== Resourceless batch infrastructure by default

The `DefaultBatchConfiguration` class has been updated to provide a "resourceless" batch infrastructure by default (based on the `ResourcelessJobRepository` implementation introduced in v5.2). This means that it no longer requires an in-memory database (like H2 or HSQLDB) for the job repository, which was previously necessary for batch metadata storage.

Moreover, this change will improve the default performance of batch applications when the meta-data is not used, as the `ResourcelessJobRepository` does not require any database connections or transactions.

Finally, this change will help to reduce the memory footprint of batch applications, as the in-memory database is no longer required for metadata storage.

=== Batch infrastructure configuration simplification

Before v6, the typical configuration of a non-trivial Spring Batch application was quite complex and required a lot of beans: `JobRepository`, `JobLauncher`, `JobExplorer`, `JobOperator`, `JobRegistry`, `JobRegistrySmartInitializingSingleton` and so on. This required a lot of configuration code, like for example the need to configure the same execution context serializer on both the `JobRepository` and `JobExplorer`.

In this release, several changes have been made to simplify the batch infrastructure configuration:

* The `JobRepository` now extends the `JobExplorer` interface, so there is no need to define a separate `JobExplorer` bean.
* The `JobOperator` now extends the `JobLauncher` interface, so there is no need to define a separate `JobLauncher` bean.
* The `JobRegistry` is now optional, and smart enough to register jobs automatically, so there is no need to define a separate `JobRegistrySmartInitializingSingleton` bean.
* The transaction manager is now optional, and a default `ResourcelessTransactionManager` is used if none is provided.

This reduces the number of beans required for a typical batch application and simplifies the configuration code.

[[new-implementation-of-the-chunk-oriented-processing-model]]
== New implementation of the chunk-oriented processing model

This is not a new feature, but rather a new implementation of the chunk-oriented processing model. This new implementation was introduced as an experimental addition in version 5.1, and is now available as stable in version 6.0.

The new implementation is provided in the `ChunkOrientedStep` class, which is a replacement for the `ChunkOrientedTasklet` / `TaskletStep` classes.

Here is an example of how to define a `ChunkOrientedStep` by using its builder:

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public Step chunkOrientedStep(JobRepository jobRepository, JdbcTransactionManager transactionManager,
        ItemReader<Person> itemReader, ItemProcessor<Person, Person> itemProcessor, ItemWriter<Person> itemWriter) {
    int chunkSize = 100;
    return new ChunkOrientedStepBuilder<Person, Person>(jobRepository, transactionManager, chunkSize)
        .reader(itemReader)
        .processor(itemProcessor)
        .writer(itemWriter)
        .build();
}
----

Moreover, fault-tolerance features were adapted as follows:

- The retry feature is now based on the retry functionality introduced in https://docs.spring.io/spring/reference/7.0/core/resilience.html[Spring Framework 7], instead of the previous Spring Retry library
- The skip feature has been slightly adapted to the new implementation, which is now only based entirely on the `SkipPolicy` interface

Here is a quick example of how to use the retry and skip features with the new `ChunkOrientedStep`:

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public Step faulTolerantChunkOrientedStep(JobRepository jobRepository, JdbcTransactionManager transactionManager,
        ItemReader<Person> itemReader, ItemProcessor<Person, Person> itemProcessor, ItemWriter<Person> itemWriter) {

    // retry policy configuration
    int maxAttempts = 10;
    var retrybaleExceptions = Set.of(TransientException.class);
    RetryPolicy retryPolicy = RetryPolicy.builder()
        .maxAttempts(maxAttempts)
        .includes(retrybaleExceptions)
        .build();

    // skip policy configuration
    int skipLimit = 50;
    var skippableExceptions = Set.of(FlatFileParseException.class);
    SkipPolicy skipPolicy = new LimitCheckingExceptionHierarchySkipPolicy(skippableExceptions, skipLimit);

    // step configuration
    int chunkSize = 100;
    return new ChunkOrientedStepBuilder<Person, Person>(jobRepository, transactionManager, chunkSize)
        .reader(itemReader)
        .processor(itemProcessor)
        .writer(itemWriter)
        .faultTolerant()
        .retryPolicy(retryPolicy)
        .skipPolicy(skipPolicy)
        .build();
}
----

[[new-concurrency-model]]
== New concurrency model

Prior to this release, the concurrency model based on the "parallel iteration" concept required a lot of state synchronization at different levels and had several limitations related to throttling and backpressure leading to confusing transaction semantics and poor performance.

This release revisits that model and comes with a new, simplified approach to concurrency based on the producer-consumer pattern. A concurrent chunk-oriented step now uses a bounded internal queue between the producer thread and consumer threads. Items are put in the queue as soon as they are ready to be processed, and consumer threads take items from the queue as soon as they are available for processing. Once a chunk is ready to be written, the producer thread pauses until the chunk is written, and then resumes producing items.

This new model is more efficient, easier to understand and provides better performance for concurrent executions.

[[new-command-line-operator]]
== New command line operator

Spring Batch provided a `CommandLineJobRunner` since version 1. While this runner served its purpose well over the years, it started to show some limitations when it comes to extensibility and customisation. Many issues like static initialisation, non-standard way of handling options and parameters, lack of extensibility, etc have been reported.

Moreover, all these issues made it impossible to reuse that runner in Spring Boot, which resulted in duplicate code in both projects as well behaviour divergence (like job parameters incrementer behaviour differences) that is confusing to many users.

This release introduces a modern version of `CommandLineJobRunner`, named `CommandLineJobOperator`, that allows you to operate batch jobs from the command line (start, stop, restart and so on) and that is customisable, extensible and updated to the new changes introduced in Spring Batch 6.

[[ability-to-recover-failed-job-executions]]
== Ability to recover failed job executions

Prior to this release, if a job execution fails abruptly, it was not possible to recover it without a manual database update. This was error-prone and not consistent across different job repositories (as it required a few SQL statements for JDBC databases and some custom statements for NoSQL stores).

This release introduces a new method named `recover` in the `JobOperator` interface that allows you to recover failed job executions consistently across all job repositories.

[[ability-to-stop-all-kind-of-steps]]
== Ability to stop all kinds of steps

As of v5.2, it is only possible to externally stop `Tasklet` steps through  `JobOperator#stop`.
If a custom `Step` implementation wants to handle external stop signals, it just can't.

This release adds a new interface, named `StoppableStep`, that extends `Step` and which can be implemented by any step that is able to handle stop signals.

[[graceful-shutdown]]
== Graceful Shutdown support

Spring Batch 6.0 introduces support for graceful shutdown of batch jobs. This feature allows you to stop a running job execution in a controlled manner, ensuring that interruption signals are correctly sent to running steps.

When a graceful shutdown is initiated, the job execution will stop currently active steps and updates the job repository with a consistent state that enables restartability. Once running steps have finished, the job execution will be marked as stopped, and any necessary cleanup operations will be performed.


[[observability-with-jfr]]
== Observability with the Java Flight Recorder (JFR)

In addition to the existing Micrometer metrics, Spring Batch 6.0 introduces support for the Java Flight Recorder (JFR) to provide enhanced observability capabilities.

JFR is a powerful profiling and event collection framework built into the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It allows you to capture detailed information about the runtime behavior of your applications with minimal performance overhead.

This release introduces several JFR events to monitor key aspects of a batch job execution, including job and step executions, item reads and writes, as well as transaction boundaries.

[[jspecify]]
== Null safety annotations with JSpecify

Spring Batch 6.0 APIs are now annotated with https://jspecify.dev/[JSpecify] annotations to provide better null-safety guarantees and improve code quality.

[[local-chunking]]
== Local chunking support

Similar to remote chunking, local chunking is a new feature that allows you to process chunks of items in parallel, locally within the same JVM using multiple threads. This is particularly useful when you have a large number of items to process and want to take advantage of multi-core processors.
With local chunking, you can configure a chunk-oriented step to use multiple threads to process chunks of items concurrently. Each thread will read, process and write its own chunk of items independently, while the step will manage the overall execution and commit the results.

[[seda-with-si]]
== SEDA style with Spring Integration message channels

In Spring Batch 5.2, we introduced the concept of SEDA (Staged Event-Driven Architecture) style processing using local threads with the `BlockingQueueItemReader` and `BlockingQueueItemWriter` components. Building on that foundation,
Spring Batch 6.0 introduces support for SEDA style processing at scale using Spring Integration messaging channels. This allows you to decouple the different stages of a batch job and process them asynchronously using message channels. By leveraging Spring Integration, you can easily configure and manage the messaging channels, as well as take advantage of features like message transformation, filtering, and routing.

[[jackson-3-support]]
== Jackson 3 support

Spring Batch 6.0 has been upgraded to support Jackson 3.x for JSON processing. This upgrade ensures compatibility with the latest features and improvements in the Jackson library, while also providing better performance and security. All JSON-related components in Spring Batch, such as the `JsonItemReader` and `JsonFileItemWriter`, as well as the `JacksonExecutionContextStringSerializer` have been updated to use Jackson 3.x by default.

The support for Jackson 2.x has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. If you are currently using Jackson 2.x in your Spring Batch applications, it is recommended to upgrade to Jackson 3.x to take advantage of the latest features and improvements.

[[remote-step-support]]
== Remote step support

This release introduces support for remote step executions, allowing you to execute steps of a batch job on remote machines or clusters.
This feature is particularly useful for large-scale batch processing scenarios where you want to distribute the workload across multiple nodes to improve performance and scalability. Remote step execution is facilitated through the use of Spring Integration messaging channels, which enable communication between the local job execution environment and the remote step executors.


[[deprecations-and-pruning]]
== Deprecations and pruning

As with any major release, some features have been deprecated or removed in Spring Batch 6.0. The following changes are worth noting:

* All deprecated APIs and features from previous versions have been removed
* Modular configuration through `@EnableBatchProcessing(modular = true)` has been deprecated
* Several APIs have been deprecated in this version, in order to simplify the core API and reduce its scope
* Deprecate JUnit 4 support in the `spring-batch-test` module
* Deprecate Jackson 2 support
* Deprecate XML configuration through the `batch:...` namespace
